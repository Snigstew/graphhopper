Test: invalidBearingsThrowsException
    //Ensures invalid input for bearings throws exceptions:
    //  non-numerical values
    //  angle values without corresponding range
    //  comma only

Test: invalidDoPostThrowsException
    //Ensures invalid or unsupported parameters in doPost
    //throws IllegalArgumentExceptions. Only specific values
    //are supported, therefore important to test all invalid
    //entries

Test: invalidDoGetParameterThrowsException
    //Ensures invalid or unsupported parameters in doGet
    //throws IllegalArgumentExceptions. The following
    //attributes must be true:
    //  - steps
    //  - roundaboutExits
    //  - bannerInstructions
    //  - voiceInstructions
    //And geometries must be equal to "polyline6"
    //All these cases are tested below

Test: doGetConstructorTest
    //Ensures invalid response from HttpServletRequest
    //throws IllegalArgumentExceptions. Here javafaker
    //and Mockito are used to mock several class
    //behaviours in order to ensure the errors thrown
    //in the constructor of doGet are thrown under the
    //proper conditions. Cases include:
    //  - wrong coordinates
    //  - wrong profile name
    //  - wrong path

Test: doGetWithErrorsReturns422
    //Ensures doGet returns 422 when GHRequest has errors
    //Many mocked classes required

Test: doPostReturns200
    //Ensures doPost returns 200 when GHResponse has no errors
    //Many mocked classes required
